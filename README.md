### Mission
Develop a flexible framework for applying AI in healthcare and a set of use cases that prove value as defined by key stakeholders. 

### Current top priorities

### Trail markers  

- 游릭 Directly on critical path 
- 游리 Ancillary to critical path  
- 游뚽 Dependency marker
- 游대 Part of iteration loop
- 驕놾잺 Done
- 游댕 Link to notebook or website

## Knowledge graph
---
### Basic knowledge
- 驕놾잺 Develop method to use GPT3 to extract conceptual relationships from the medical literature [游댕](GPT_fine-tuning.ipynb#performance_assessment)
- 游릭 Engineer a knowledge model on which a simple, flexible reasoning framework can operate to fulfill use cases (游대Iterate with reasoning framework and use cases)
- 游릭 Fine-tune GPT3 to extract knowledge according to the knowledge model 
    - Manually annotate training data for fine-tuning [游댕](Annotation_Tool.ipynb#annotator_tool)
    - Perform fine-tuning [游댕](Annotation_Tool.ipynb#GPT3_fine_tuner)
- 游릭 Peform extraction from key sources:
    - 游릭 PubMed
    - 游리 UpToDate (游뚽Partner with UpToDate)
    - 游리 Medical textbooks (游뚽Partners with a publisher like Elsevier)

### Clinical Practice Guidelines
- 游리 Consider partnering with [EvidenceCare](https://apporchard.epic.com/Gallery?id=1594), who have already started to build this integration for Epic
- 游리 Identify guidelines of interest to users (e.g. [Anticoagulation guidelines for patients with atrial fibrillation](https://www.jacc.org/doi/pdf/10.1016/j.jacc.2019.01.011))
- 游리 Develop patient data queries that retrieve all necessary data for a clinical decision-making process from the EHR
- 游리 Manually write the guidelines into executable code that produces recommendations, explanations, and evidence. Consider automating the code generation with:
    - [Retrieval-based NLP](http://ai.stanford.edu/blog/retrieval-based-NLP/) or
    - Fine-tuned transformer language models
- 游리 Present the data for verification to the clinician/patient
- 游리 Execute the decision-making process to produce a recommendation
- 游리 Present the guideline recommendations with links to the evidence behind the recommendation

## Connected patient-level data
---
- 驕놾잺 Import MIMIC-III into graph [游댕](MIMIC-III_v1.4_MI1_import.ipynb)
- 驕놾잺 Import UMLS concepts and relationships into graph [游댕](UMLS_import.ipynb)
- 驕놾잺 MIMIC-III Labs to UMLS Concepts (LOINC-AUI) [游댕](MIMIC-III_v1.4_MI1_import.ipynb#MIMIC_labs_to_UMLS)
- 驕놾잺 MIMIC-III Prescriptions to UMLS Concepts [游댕](MIMIC-III_v1.4_MI1_import.ipynb#MIMIC_Rx_to_UMLS)
- 驕놾잺 MIMIC-III Problems to UMLS concepts [游댕](MIMIC-III_v1.4_MI1_import.ipynb#UMLS_problem_creation)
    - 游릭 Improve quality of NLP? - it seemed to work poorly for atrial fibrillation
- 游릭 MIMIC-III ICD diagnoses to UMLS concepts [游댕](MIMIC-III_v1.4_MI1_import.ipynb#MIMIC_ICD_Dx_to_UMLS)
- 游리 MIMIC-III procedures to UMLS concepts (e.g. EKG)
- 游리 MIMIC-III imaging to UMLS concepts

## Virtualized Population
---
- 游리 Develop model to accurately and precisely represent populations
    - 游리 Include temporal information
- 游리 Apply the model to virtualize MIMIC-III
- 游리 Adapt use case code to run on virtual population
- 游리 Update virtual population from new incoming patient data
- 游리 Update a global virtual population from a local version
- 游리 Automate updates as part of an MLOps process
  
## Reasoning Framework
---
- 游릭 Design a set of reasoning methods that can flexibly interact with the knowledge graph and patient data to fulfill use cases (游대 with knowledge graph and use cases)

    | Status | Process      | Output |
    | :---: | :---- |:---|  
    |游릭| Find association between a patient-connected starting concept and the outcome concept you wish to avoid      | Path-defining start and end nodes       |
    |游릭| Find all shortest paths between the patient and outcome concept through the knowledge graph   | Pathologic paths relevant to this patient        |
    |游릭| Push out from pathologic path to find concepts which are known to disrupt elements of the pathologic path | Theoretical treatments with explanations |  
    |游릭| Find associations between outcome concepts and possible treatments, ordered by strongest association first | Empiric treatments and other associations |  
    |游릭| Find shortest paths between possible treatments and the pathologic path | Rationalizations for empiric treatment |

Consider using [Max De Marzi's methods to create dynamic rule-based decision trees in Neo4j.](https://maxdemarzi.com/2018/01/14/dynamic-rule-based-decision-trees-in-neo4j/#more-4189) 

## Use Cases

- 游릭 "I have a patient with AFib. Should I anticoagulate?" Contributed by Dr. Stein, Scripps CMIO-Inpatient. [游댕](Documents/P2_Prototype/UseCase_AntiCoag_AF.ipynb)
