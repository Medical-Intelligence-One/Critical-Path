### Mission
Develop a flexible framework for applying AI in healthcare and a set of use cases that prove value as defined by key stakeholders. 

### Current top priorities
- Fulfill Dr. Stein's use case
    - 游대 Develop a reasoning framework
    - 游대 Develop a knowledge model
    - Fine-tune GPT3 for the knowledge model
    - 驕놾잺 Collect all relevant literature
    - Extract relationships from relevant literature
    - Import GPT-extracted relationships into the graph
    - Test the system on MIMIC-III patients
    - Demo for Dr. Stein

### Immediate next steps:
- Add 2-3 more use cases 
- Share Neo4j's embedding webinar with Nikesh
- Reformat the knowledge graph to have all synonyms point to a central "preferred term" (驕놾잺 UMLS_test, 游릭 MIMIC-III_v1.4_MI-1)
- 游대 Develop pathologic pathfinding methods using existing `CAUSE_OF` relationships from UMLS
- 游대 Develop intervention pathfinding methods using pathologic paths and `MAY_TREAT` or `MAY_PREVENT` relationships
- 驕놾잺 set up the annotator to display UMLS concept capture for each sentence
- 驕놾잺 pull all the literature relevant to atrial fibrillation, stroke, anticoagulation, and hemorrhage/bleeding ([UseCase_AntiCoag_AF.ipynb](UseCase_AntiCoag_AF.ipynb))
- 驕놾잺 create a csv of sentences that have causal relationships from the Afib literature
- 游대 create a knowledge model that anchors on UMLS terms or their existance-state opposites (e.g. "no atrial fibrillation") connected to literature-provided terms with `STATE_OF` relationships
- develop methods to weight relationships based on number of publications and quality of publications
- import human-annotated relationships into the graph to test pathologic and treatment pathfinding
- fine-tune GPT3 on the new knowledge model to import more literature

## Knowledge graph
---
### Basic knowledge
- 驕놾잺 Develop method to use GPT3 to extract conceptual relationships from the medical literature [游댕](GPT_fine-tuning.ipynb#performance_assessment)
- 游릭 Engineer a knowledge model on which a simple, flexible reasoning framework can operate to fulfill use cases (游대Iterate with reasoning framework and use cases)
- 游릭 Fine-tune GPT3 to extract knowledge according to the knowledge model 
    - Manually annotate training data for fine-tuning [游댕](Annotation_Tool.ipynb#annotator_tool)
    - Perform fine-tuning [游댕](Annotation_Tool.ipynb#GPT3_fine_tuner)
- 游릭 Peform extraction from key sources:
    - 游릭 PubMed
    - 游리 UpToDate (游뚽Partner with UpToDate)
    - 游리 Medical textbooks (游뚽Partners with a publisher like Elsevier)

<a id='cpld'></a>
### Clinical Practice Guidelines
- 游리 Consider partnering with [EvidenceCare](https://apporchard.epic.com/Gallery?id=1594), who have already started to build this integration for Epic
- 游리 Identify guidelines of interest to users (e.g. [Anticoagulation guidelines for patients with atrial fibrillation](https://www.jacc.org/doi/pdf/10.1016/j.jacc.2019.01.011))
- 游리 Develop patient data queries that retrieve all necessary data for a clinical decision-making process from the EHR
- 游리 Manually write the guidelines into executable code that produces recommendations, explanations, and evidence. Consider automating the code generation with:
    - [Retrieval-based NLP](http://ai.stanford.edu/blog/retrieval-based-NLP/) or
    - Fine-tuned transformer language models
- 游리 Present the data for verification to the clinician/patient
- 游리 Execute the decision-making process to produce a recommendation
- 游리 Present the guideline recommendations with links to the evidence behind the recommendation

## Connected patient-level data
---
- 驕놾잺 Import MIMIC-III into graph [游댕](MIMIC-III_v1.4_MI1_import.ipynb)
- 驕놾잺 Import UMLS concepts and relationships into graph [游댕](UMLS_import.ipynb)

## Reasoning Framework
---
- 游릭 Design a set of reasoning methods that can flexibly interact with the knowledge graph and patient data to fulfill use cases [游댕](Reasoning_Framework.ipynb) (游대 with knowledge graph and use cases)

    | Status | Process      | Output |
    | :---: | :---- |:---|  
    |游릭| Find association between a patient-connected starting concept and the outcome concept you wish to avoid      | Path-defining start and end nodes       |
    |游릭| Find all shortest paths between the patient and outcome concept through the knowledge graph   | Pathologic paths relevant to this patient        |
    |游릭| Push out from pathologic path to find concepts which are known to disrupt elements of the pathologic path | Theoretical treatments with explanations |  
    |游릭| Find associations between outcome concepts and possible treatments, ordered by strongest association first | Empiric treatments and other associations |  
    |游릭| Find shortest paths between possible treatments and the pathologic path | Rationalizations for empiric treatment |

Consider using [Max De Marzi's methods to create dynamic rule-based decision trees in Neo4j.](https://maxdemarzi.com/2018/01/14/dynamic-rule-based-decision-trees-in-neo4j/#more-4189)
