## Virtualized Population
---
- 游리 Develop model to accurately and precisely represent populations
    - 游리 Include temporal information
- 游리 Apply the model to virtualize MIMIC-III
- 游리 Adapt use case code to run on virtual population
- 游리 Update virtual population from new incoming patient data
- 游리 Update a global virtual population from a local version
- 游리 Automate updates as part of an MLOps process
  
## Reasoning Framework
---
- 游릭 Design a set of reasoning methods that can flexibly interact with the knowledge graph and patient data to fulfill use cases (游대 with knowledge graph and use cases)

    | Status | Process      | Output |
    | :---: | :---- |:---|  
    |游릭| Find association between a patient-connected starting concept and the outcome concept you wish to avoid      | Path-defining start and end nodes       |
    |游릭| Find all shortest paths between the patient and outcome concept through the knowledge graph   | Pathologic paths relevant to this patient        |
    |游릭| Push out from pathologic path to find concepts which are known to disrupt elements of the pathologic path | Theoretical treatments with explanations |  
    |游릭| Find associations between outcome concepts and possible treatments, ordered by strongest association first | Empiric treatments and other associations |  
    |游릭| Find shortest paths between possible treatments and the pathologic path | Rationalizations for empiric treatment |
