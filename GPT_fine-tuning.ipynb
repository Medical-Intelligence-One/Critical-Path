From there, performance tends to linearly increase with every doubling of the number of examples.\" \n",

These test prompts will be formatted identically to a single training example, and will end with \"Relationships:\" It won't need the hash tags since there are no other training examples to separate from the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "After fine-tuning, we'll run 100 samples. I'll correct those samples, measure the accuracy, and add them to the next iteration's fine-tuning dataset. We'll repeat the process of running 100 new samples per iteration, measuring accuracy, and adding the human-corrected version to the dataset for fine-tuning the next iteration until we reach >99% accuracy, we see the accuracy plateau, or when it would be prohibitively expensive to continue refining the model. We will keep a model registry with a model identifier and the text used for fine-tuning the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have other users, we will add any corrections they make to the fine-tuning data, which will be used next time we fine-tune a model. Eventually this fine-tuning data will become a very valuable resource, as it can also be used on more advanced GPT models when they become available (e.g. a model with more parameters, more relevant training data, etc)."

    "Note that this approach may not be pursued. Upon attempting it, I found that some relationships have properties that others do not, so it may be necessary to develop training data for each relationship type individually. For example, the property of relationship strength makes sense for the \"associated with\" relationship but not the \"is a\" relationship. What follows is the code I used to annotate several relationship types. I'm leaving it in so it can be repurposed."

      "Marginal Sufficient Component Cause Model: An Emerging Causal Model With Merits?\n",
      "Abstract:\n",
      "For decades, the sufficient cause model and the counterfactual model have shaped our understanding of causation in biomedical science, and the link between these two models has enabled us to obtain a deeper understanding of causality. Recently, a new causal model-the marginal sufficient component cause model-was proposed and applied in the context of interaction or mediation. The proponents of this model have emphasized its utility in visualizing the presence of \"agonism\" (a subtype of mechanistic interaction) in the counterfactual framework, claiming that the concept of agonism has not been clearly defined in causal inference and that agonistic interaction cannot be visualized by the conventional sufficient cause model. In this article, we illustrate that careful scrutiny based on the conventional sufficient cause model yields further insights into the concept of agonism in a more biologic sense. We primarily focus on the following three points: (1) \"agonism\" defined in the counterfactual model can be visualized as sets of sufficient causes in the conventional sufficient cause model; (2) although the so-called independent competing assumption or no redundancy assumption may seem irrelevant in the marginal sufficient component cause model, researchers do need to assume that potential completion times of relevant marginal sufficient causes differ; and (3) possibly differing potential completion times of marginal sufficient causes cannot be discerned until their hidden mechanistic paths are considered in the conventional sufficient cause model. In this rapidly progressing field of research, decades after its introduction, the sufficient cause model retains its worth.\n"
