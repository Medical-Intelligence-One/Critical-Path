 Elective surgery cancellation is considered a fundamental problem in health care services-it causes considerable disruption to patient flow, further eroding often already stretched operating capacity, and consequentially reduces both hospital performance and patient satisfaction.

Prompt:
 Neurocritical diseases and conditions are common causes of long-term disability and mortality. 

Completion:
neurocritical diseases | causes | long-term disability
neurocritical conditions | causes | long-term disability

#####

Prompt:
 The protozoan Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of diarrhoea morbidity and mortality in children younger than 5 years. 

Completion:
Cryptosporidium | causes | diarrhoea morbidity
Cryptosporidium | causes | diarrhoea mortality

#####

Prompt:
However, the true global burden of Cryptosporidium infection in children younger than 5 years might have been underestimated in previous quantifications because it only took account of the acute effects of diarrhoea.

#####

Prompt:
 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provide effective analgesia during the post-operative period but can cause acute kidney injury (AKI) when used peri-operatively (at or around the time of surgery). 

Completion:
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) | causes | acute kidney injury (AKI)

#####

Prompt:
 Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a disease characterized by the presence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia, caused by the congenital or acquired decrease of the enzyme activity which degrades unusual large vWF multimers. 

Completion:
congenital decrease of enzyme activity | causes | thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
acquired decrease of enzyme activity | causes | thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)

#####

Prompt:
There is no identifiable cause in half of the acquired TTP cases. 

Completion:


#####

Prompt:
 Rhabdomyolysis is a rare, potentially life-threatening condition, caused by multiple disorders. 

Completion:


#####

Prompt:
 In this review, burn injuries caused by application of raw garlic are reported. 

Completion:
raw garlic | causes | burn injuries

#####

Prompt:
 In most of the cases, garlic caused second-degree burns, although some circumstances can cause formation of necrotic tissue. 

Completion:
garlic | causes | second-degree burns

#####

Prompt:
 Surgical patients may experience inadvertent perioperative hypothermia, a condition that can cause a variety of complications, including surgical site infection (SSI). 

Completion:
perioperative hypothermia | causes | complications
perioperative hypothermia | causes | surgical site infection (SSI)

#####

Prompt:
 Moyamoya disease (MMD) and moyamoya syndrome (MMS) are a rare cause of stroke commonly managed surgically. 

Completion:
moyamoya disease (MMD) | causes | stroke
moyamoya syndrome (MMS) | causes | stroke

#####

Prompt:
 However, there are some deficiencies in the past research, because the vast majority of known infertile patients were included in the study samples. 

Completion:


#####

Prompt:
Taking infertile men as the research object to analyse the impact of obesity on semen quality, which cannot accurately prove that the impact on semen quality is caused by obesity, because the impact on semen quality may also be caused by other factors. 

Completion:


#####

Prompt:
 Meibomian gland dysfunction is one of the most common ocular disorders encountered by ophthalmologists and is the leading cause of evaporative dry eye. 

Completion:
meibomian gland dysfunction | causes | evaporative dry eye

#####

Prompt:
The disease causes significant morbidity in the population such that patients seek treatment. 

Completion:


#####

Prompt:
 For several decades, most physicians have believed that acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is caused by coronary thrombosis resulting from rupture of vulnerable plaque characterized by a thin fibrous cap overlying a large necrotic core and massive inflammatory cell infiltration. 

Completion:


#####

Prompt:
However, nearly one-third of ACS cases are caused by plaque erosion characterized by intact fibrous cap, less or absent necrotic core, less inflammation, and large lumen. 

Completion:
plaque erosion | causes | ACS

#####

Prompt:
Because of the limitations of current imaging modalities, including angiography and intravascular ultrasound, the importance of plaque erosion as a cause of acute coronary events is less well known. 

Completion:


#####

Prompt:
 More importantly, the introduction of OCT to clinical practice enables us to differentiate the patients with ACS caused by plaque erosion from those caused by plaque rupture, thereby providing precise and personalized therapy based on the different underlying mechanisms. 

Completion:
plaque erosion | causes | ACS
plaque rupture | causes | ACS
