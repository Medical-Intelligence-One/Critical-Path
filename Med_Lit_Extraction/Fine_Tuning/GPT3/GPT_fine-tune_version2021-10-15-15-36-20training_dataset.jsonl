{"prompt":"However, nearly one-third of ACS cases are caused by plaque erosion characterized by intact fibrous cap, less or absent necrotic core, less inflammation, and large lumen. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" \nplaque erosion | causes | ACS\n#####"}
{"prompt":"Because of the limitations of current imaging modalities, including angiography and intravascular ultrasound, the importance of plaque erosion as a cause of acute coronary events is less well known. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" \n\n#####"}
{"prompt":" More importantly, the introduction of OCT to clinical practice enables us to differentiate the patients with ACS caused by plaque erosion from those caused by plaque rupture, thereby providing precise and personalized therapy based on the different underlying mechanisms. \n\n###\n\n","completion":" \nplaque erosion | causes | ACS\nplaque rupture | causes | ACS\n#####"}
