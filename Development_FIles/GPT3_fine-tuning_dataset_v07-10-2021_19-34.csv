" Moreover, there is an absence of unified view of the causative factors of corruption identified in construction project management (CPM). 

###

"," 

#####"
"This paper, therefore, presents a comprehensive review of the causes of corruption from selected articles in recognized construction management journals to address the mentioned gaps. 

###

"A total number of 44 causes of corruption were identified from 37 publications and analyzed in terms of existing causal factors of corruption, annual trend of publications and the thematic categorization of the identified variables. 

###

"," 

#####"
"The most identifiable causes were over close relationships, poor professional ethical standards, negative industrial and working conditions, negative role models and inadequate sanctions. 

###
