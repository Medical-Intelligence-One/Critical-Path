In the past 20 years, two additional epidemics caused by CoVs have occurred: severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV, which has caused a large-scale epidemic in China and 24 other countries; and respiratory syndrome-CoV of the Middle East in Saudi Arabia, which continues to cause sporadic cases. All of these viruses affect the lower respiratory tract and manifest as pneumonia in humans, but the novel SARS-Cov-2 appears to be more contagious and has spread more rapidly worldwide. This mini-review focuses on the cellular immune response to COVID-19 in human subjects, compared to other clinically relevant coronaviruses to evaluate its role in the control of infection and pathogenesis and accelerate the development of a preventive vaccine or immune therapies.","

Many authors advocate lipase as the preferred serological test for the diagnosis of pancreatitis and a cut-off level of three or more times the upper limit of normal (ULN) is often quoted. The literature contains no systematic review that explores alternative causes of a lipase level over three times as high as the ULN. Such a review was therefore the objective of this study.,,

However, substantial evidence suggests that the burden of Mycobacterium bovis, the cause of bovine tuberculosis, might be underestimated in human beings as the cause of zoonotic tuberculosis. In 2013, results from a systematic review and meta-analysis of global zoonotic tuberculosis showed that the same challenges and concerns expressed 15 years ago remain valid. These challenges faced by people with zoonotic tuberculosis might not be proportional to the scientific attention and resources allocated in recent years to other diseases.

Infections in humans mainly present as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, most cases of CAP are treated without diagnostic testing, and the importance of C. psittaci infection as a cause of CAP is therefore unclear. In this meta-analysis of published CAP-aetiological studies, we estimate the proportion of CAP caused by C. psittaci infection. The databases MEDLINE and Embase were systematically searched for relevant studies published from 1986 onwards. Only studies that consisted of 100 patients or more were included. In total, 57 studies were selected for the meta-analysis. C. psittaci was the causative pathogen in 1Â·03% (95% CI 0Â·79-1Â·30) of all CAP cases from the included studies combined, with a range between studies from 0 to 6Â·7%.

Disulfiram is reduced to carbon disulfide, also a stable compound in blood. Nitric oxide reacts with foul-smelling volatile organosulfur compounds. The degradation of penicillamine raises the pH level, favouring the growth of gram-negative bacteria in the oral cavity producing halitosis.

Disulfiram is reduced to carbon disulfide, also a stable compound in blood. Nitric oxide reacts with foul-smelling volatile organosulfur compounds. The degradation of penicillamine raises the pH level, favouring the growth of gram-negative bacteria in the oral cavity producing halitosis. Chloral hydrate, phenothiazine, and paraldehyde could not be related to halitosis. The analysis showed that halitosis can be caused by medication but does not correlate to any specific disease or specific form of drug therapy. The pharmacological compounds identified as causes of halitosis are administered to treat a broad spectrum of diseases, or in therapeutic regimes.","

","A NOVEL DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH TO PATIENTS WITH MYOCLONUS. Myoclonus is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by brief, involuntary muscular jerks. Recognition of myoclonus and determination of the underlying aetiology remains challenging given that both acquired and genetically determined disorders have varied manifestations. The diagnostic work-up in myoclonus is often time-consuming and costly, and a definitive diagnosis is reached in only a minority of patients. On the basis of a systematic literature review up to June 2015, we propose a novel diagnostic eight-step algorithm to help clinicians accurately, efficiently and cost-effectively diagnose myoclonus. The large number of genes implicated in myoclonus and the wide clinical variation of these genetic disorders emphasize the need for novel diagnostic techniques. Therefore, and for the first time, we incorporate next-generation sequencing (NGS) in a diagnostic algorithm for myoclonus. The initial step of the algorithm is to confirm whether the movement disorder phenotype is consistent with, myoclonus, and to define its anatomical subtype. The next steps are aimed at identification of both treatable acquired causes and those genetic causes of myoclonus that require a diagnostic approach other than NGS. Finally, other genetic diseases that could cause myoclonus can be investigated simultaneously by NGS techniques. To facilitate NGS diagnostics, we provide a comprehensive list of genes associated with myoclonus. ",,

","ANTI-VEGF THERAPY FOR RETINAL VEIN OCCLUSIONS. Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common cause of visual loss in the Western World. RVO is usually classified into branch RVO (BRVO) and central RVO (CRVO) according to the anatomical site of the vascular occlusion. The pathogenesis of RVO is not yet fully understood, however an important event is the intraluminal thrombus formation, which is usually secondary to several conditions such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and thrombophilia. The blockage of venous circulation causes an elevation of intraluminal pressure in the capillaries, leading to hemorrhages and leakage of fluid within the retina, increase of interstitial pressure and a consequent reduction of retinal perfusion. Ischemia may develop resulting in secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that causes further vascular leakage and retinal oedema. VEGF has therefore a leading role in RVO pathogenesis and symptoms. As a consequence use of anti-VEGF agents by intravitreal injections has become very common with the aim to improve the clinical outcomes in these patients. Currently 2 anti-VEGF agents (ranimizumab and aflibercept) have been FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and EMA (European Medicine Agency) approved for the treatment of RVO, while another VEGF inhibitor (bevacizumab) is often used ""off-label"" in clinical practice. Many treatment regimens have been suggested in the clinical trials with these drugs, as monthly injections or injections when needed, however the ideal regimen has not been defined yet. We conducted a systematic review searching MEDLINE for the following terms: retinal vein occlusion, ranibizumab, bevacizumab, aflibercept, vascular endothelial growth factor, macular oedema.

A systematic literature review of observational studies was conducted by searching Medline, Embase, and clinical trials registries for articles published from January 2010 to March 2020, using the search terms: hemophilia A (HA), mortality, cause of death. Interventional studies, studies not reporting fatalities, and those reporting only on hemophilia B, acquired HA, or mixed other coagulopathies were excluded. Overall, 7818 unique records were identified and 17 were analyzed. Of these, six reported mortality rates and five reported mortality ratios. Mortality generally decreased over time, despite a spike associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the 1980s and 1990s. Mortality was strongly correlated with age and hemophilia severity. People with hemophilia had a raised mortality risk compared with the general population, particularly in severe hemophilia, and when infected with HIV or HCV.

After review, it was determined that there is limited research regarding ankle and foot deviations and their connection to LBP. Reviewed studies have linked flat feet, ankle instability, sagittal plane blockage and excessive pronation to LBP. Specifically, excessive pronation has been shown to cause leg length discrepancies leading to pelvic tilts and LBP. Based on these results, ankle and foot deviations can be considered a potential cause for LBP due to the disruption of the kinetic chain from the foot to the back. Clinicians should consider the foot and ankle when addressing LBP, especially if more conventional etiologies fail to describe the condition.","

Though LBP can be caused by acute injuries, biomechanical discrepancies have also been indicated to cause chronic LBP. A possible link between podiatrical deviations and LBP has been established in the literature; yet, no comprehensive review investigating the effects of foot and ankle deviations on low back pain has been published. The aim of this study was to assess the relevant literature concerning the effects of foot and ankle deviations on LBP. After review, it was determined that there is limited research regarding ankle and foot deviations and their connection to LBP. Reviewed studies have linked flat feet, ankle instability, sagittal plane blockage and excessive pronation to LBP. Specifically, excessive pronation has been shown to cause leg length discrepancies leading to pelvic tilts and LBP. Based on these results, ankle and foot deviations can be considered a potential cause for LBP due to the disruption of the kinetic chain from the foot to the back. Clinicians should consider the foot and ankle when addressing LBP, especially if more conventional etiologies fail to describe the condition.","

Moreover, the presence of silent infarcts more than doubles the risk of subsequent stroke and dementia.

","NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DECOMPENSATION IN ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS WITH PHELAN-MCDERMID SYNDROME: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE. Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) is caused by haploinsufficiency of the SHANK3 gene on chromosome 22q13.33 and is characterized by intellectual disability, hypotonia, severe speech impairments, and autism spectrum disorder. Emerging evidence indicates that there are changes over time in the phenotype observed in individuals with PMS, including severe neuropsychiatric symptoms and loss of skills occurring in adolescence and adulthood. To gain further insight into these phenomena and to better understand the long-term course of the disorder, we conducted a systematic literature review and identified 56 PMS cases showing signs of behavioral and neurologic decompensation in adolescence or adulthood (30 females, 25 males, 1 gender unknown). Clinical presentations included features of bipolar disorder, catatonia, psychosis, and loss of skills, occurring at a mean age of 20âyears. There were no apparent sex differences in the rates of these disorders except for catatonia, which appeared to be more frequent in females (13 females, 3 males). Reports of individuals with point mutations in SHANK3 exhibiting neuropsychiatric decompensation and loss of skills demonstrate that loss of one copy of SHANK3 is sufficient to cause these manifestations. In the majority of cases, no apparent cause could be identified; in others, symptoms appeared after acute events, such as infections, prolonged or particularly intense seizures, or changes in the individual's environment. Several individuals had a progressive neurological deterioration, including one with juvenile onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, a severe demyelinating disorder caused by recessive mutations in the ARSA gene in 22q13.33. These reports provide insights into treatment options that have proven helpful in some cases, and are reviewed herein. Our survey highlights how little is currently known about neuropsychiatric presentations and loss of skills in PMS and underscores the importance of studying the natural history in individuals with PMS, including both cross-sectional and long-term longitudinal analyses. Clearer delineation of these neuropsychiatric symptoms will contribute to their recognition and prompt management and will also help uncover the underlying biological mechanisms, potentially leading to improved interventions.","

We performed a systematic review to assess the following in this population: (1) the main causes of acute and recurrent cough, either exercise-induced or not, (2) how cough is assessed, and (3) how cough is treated in this population. From the systematic review, suggestions for management were developed.",,

","CAUSATION IN EPIDEMIOLOGY. Causation is an essential concept in epidemiology, yet there is no single, clearly articulated definition for the discipline. From a systematic review of the literature, five categories can be delineated: production, necessary and sufficient, sufficient-component, counterfactual, and probabilistic. Strengths and weaknesses of these categories are examined in terms of proposed characteristics of a useful scientific definition of causation: it must be specific enough to distinguish causation from mere correlation, but not so narrow as to eliminate apparent causal phenomena from consideration. Two categories-production and counterfactual-are present in any definition of causation but are not themselves sufficient as definitions. The necessary and sufficient cause definition assumes that all causes are deterministic. The sufficient-component cause definition attempts to explain probabilistic phenomena via unknown component causes. Thus, on both of these views, heavy smoking can be cited as a cause of lung cancer only when the existence of unknown deterministic variables is assumed. The probabilistic definition, however, avoids these assumptions and appears to best fit the characteristics of a useful definition of causation. It is also concluded that the probabilistic definition is consistent with scientific and public health goals of epidemiology. In debates in the literature over these goals, proponents of epidemiology as pure science tend to favour a narrower deterministic notion of causation models while proponents of epidemiology as public health tend to favour a probabilistic view. The authors argue that a single definition of causation for the discipline should be and is consistent with both of these aims. It is concluded that a counterfactually-based probabilistic definition is more amenable to the quantitative tools of epidemiology, is consistent with both deterministic and probabilistic phenomena, and serves equally well for the acquisition and the application of scientific knowledge.",,

The unexpected occurrence of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, in a patient with cancer requires urgent diagnosis and appropriate management. TMA is a term used to describe multiple syndromes caused by microvascular thrombosis, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), Shiga toxin-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome, and complement-mediated TMA. In patients with cancer, systemic microvascular metastases and bone marrow involvement can cause microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. This occurs most often in patients with known metastatic cancer, but microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia may occur unexpectedly in patients without known metastatic disease or be the presenting features of undiagnosed cancer. TMA may also be caused by commonly used chemotherapy agents, either through dose-dependent toxicity or an acute immune-mediated reaction. These causes of TMA must be distinguished from TTP, which results from a severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 and is the most common cause of TMA among adults without cancer. The importance of this distinction is to avoid inappropriate use of plasma exchange, which is associated with major complications. Plasma exchange is the essential treatment for TTP, but it has no known benefit for patients with cancer-induced or drug-induced TMA.

A literature review of paresthesia in endodontics was undertaken, with a view to identifying and discussing the most commonly affected nerves, the diagnostic process and the treatment options. Among reported cases, the most commonly affected nerves were those passing through the jaw: the inferior alveolar nerve, the mental nerve and the lingual nerve. To diagnose paresthesia, the endodontist must carry out a complete medical history, panoramic and periapical radiography, and (in some cases) computed tomography, as well as mechanoceptive and nociceptive tests. To date, no specific treatment for endodontic-related paresthesia has been described in the literature, since the problem may be related to a variety of causes.","

","ENDODONTIC-RELATED FACIAL PARESTHESIA: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. Paresthesia is a neurosensitivity disorder caused by injury to the neural tissue.

","GLOBAL EMERGENCE OF ENTEROVIRUS D68: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. Since its discovery in California in 1962, reports of enterovirus D68 have been infrequent. Before 2014, infections were confirmed in only 699 people worldwide. In August, 2014, two paediatric hospitals in the USA reported increases in the number of patients with severe respiratory illness, with an over-representation in children with asthma. Shortly after, the authorities recognised a nationwide outbreak, which then spread to Canada, Europe, and Asia. In 2014, more than 2000 cases of enterovirus D68 were reported in 20 countries. Concurrently, clusters of children with acute flaccid paralysis of unknown cause were reported in several US states and in Europe. Enterovirus D68 infection was confirmed in some of the paralysed children, but not all. Complications in patients who were severely neurologically affected resemble those caused by poliomyelitis. In this paper we systematically review reports on enterovirus D68 to estimate its global epidemiology and its ability to cause respiratory infections and neurological damage in children. We extracted data from 70 papers to report on prevalence, symptoms, hospitalisation and mortality, and complications of enterovirus D68, both before and during the large outbreak of 2014. The magnitude and severity of the enterovirus D68 outbreak underscores a need for improved diagnostic work-up of paediatric respiratory illness, not only to prevent unnecessary use of antibiotics, but also to ensure better surveillance of diseases. Existing surveillance systems should be assessed in terms of capacity and ability to detect and report any upsurge of respiratory viruses such as enterovirus D68 in a timely manner, and focus should be paid to development of preventive measures against these emerging enteroviruses that have potential for severe disease.",,

","PATIENT SATISFACTION AND FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES FOLLOWING SECONDARY PATELLAR RESURFACING. When secondary patellar resurfacing is performed, a uniformly and widely used scoring system that is validated for anterior knee pain caused by a retropatellar degeneration will give more insight into the results of this procedure. The cause of anterior knee pain following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is not always related to the patella itself. Other causes have been identified, such as an insufficient posterior cruciate ligament in the case of a posterior cruciate-retaining TKA or an internally rotated femoral and/or tibial component. Treatment of anterior knee pain following primary TKA with secondary patellar resurfacing is a controversial procedure with uncertain outcomes. The purpose of this study is to systematically review the available peer-reviewed literature on patient satisfaction and functional outcomes of secondary resurfacing. The authors performed a systematic computerized database search of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, and EMBASE in October 2014. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. A total of 15 articles met the inclusion criteria. In total, 148 (64%) of 232 patients were satisfied with the outcomes of secondary patellar resurfacing. A statistically significant improvement in knee scores was noted in all 9 studies that reported functional outcomes, although no clinically significant improvement in knee scores was observed. Reported complications include infections and impaired wound healing, patellar instability, and patellar fracture. Because the available evidence is of generally low quality, the results of this systematic review only support a weak recommendation for secondary patellar resurfacing if patient satisfaction and clinically important improvement of functional outcomes are the desired endpoints.

A computerised literature search of MEDLINE (1966 to February 2005) and EMBASE (1980 to February 2005) was undertaken. The Internet was searched using URL: www.google.com. The proceedings of the North American Congress of Clinical Toxicology (NACCT) and the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) were hand searched. All cases of unintentional antipsychotic (all classes) poisoning in children aged 0-6 years were included. The data extracted included the age, weight, antipsychotic, dose, clinical effects, treatment and outcomes. The toxic dose was estimated as the lowest dose causing objective adverse effects.Sixty-eight reports were identified. Few contained all of the required information. Most of the case series included multiple antipsychotics with limited information on individual drugs or all ages with limited paediatric information. For most antipsychotics the ingestion of one tablet caused symptoms that were sometimes severe and usually lasted from 1 to 3 days. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were often delayed for up to 12-24 hours. Chlorpromazine caused CNS depression, hypotension and miosis; EPS and cardiac effects were rare, and the toxic dose was estimated to be 15 mg/kg. Haloperidol caused drowsiness (rarely coma) and over one-half of patients had neuromuscular effects (mainly EPS), with a toxic dose estimated at 0.15 mg/kg. Thioridazine caused CNS depression and potentially cardiac effects, with a toxic dose of 1.4 mg/kg. Atypical antipsychotics caused significant CNS depression (except risperidone); EPS were less common. Toxic doses were clozapine 2.5 mg/kg, olanzapine 0.5 mg/kg and aripiprazole 3 mg/kg. EPS responded to anticholinergic drug treatment. In summary, unintentional antipsychotic ingestion in children can cause severe effects that last 1-3 days, often with one tablet.

","ANTIPSYCHOTIC POISONING IN YOUNG CHILDREN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. The aim of this review was to determine the spectrum and severity of effects of unintentional antipsychotic poisoning in children. A computerised literature search of MEDLINE (1966 to February 2005) and EMBASE (1980 to February 2005) was undertaken. The Internet was searched using URL: www.google.com. The proceedings of the North American Congress of Clinical Toxicology (NACCT) and the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) were hand searched. All cases of unintentional antipsychotic (all classes) poisoning in children aged 0-6 years were included. The data extracted included the age, weight, antipsychotic, dose, clinical effects, treatment and outcomes. The toxic dose was estimated as the lowest dose causing objective adverse effects.Sixty-eight reports were identified. Few contained all of the required information. Most of the case series included multiple antipsychotics with limited information on individual drugs or all ages with limited paediatric information. For most antipsychotics the ingestion of one tablet caused symptoms that were sometimes severe and usually lasted from 1 to 3 days. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were often delayed for up to 12-24 hours. Chlorpromazine caused CNS depression, hypotension and miosis; EPS and cardiac effects were rare, and the toxic dose was estimated to be 15 mg/kg. Haloperidol caused drowsiness (rarely coma) and over one-half of patients had neuromuscular effects (mainly EPS), with a toxic dose estimated at 0.15 mg/kg. Thioridazine caused CNS depression and potentially cardiac effects, with a toxic dose of 1.4 mg/kg. Atypical antipsychotics caused significant CNS depression (except risperidone); EPS were less common. Toxic doses were clozapine 2.5 mg/kg, olanzapine 0.5 mg/kg and aripiprazole 3 mg/kg. EPS responded to anticholinergic drug treatment. In summary, unintentional antipsychotic ingestion in children can cause severe effects that last 1-3 days, often with one tablet. Children potentially ingesting a toxic dose or who are symptomatic should be considered for assessment in hospital. Most cases resolve with good supportive care. Toxic doses are only estimates that are based on limited data and should be used with caution until prospective studies are undertaken.","

","CANCERS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INFECTIONS IN CANADA. Infections are estimated to cause approximately 15% of the world's cancers with large geographic variations. Yet, Canadian estimates for specific cancer-causing infections are not available. To estimate the number of infection-associated cancers diagnosed among Canadian adults in 2015, we calculated population attributable risks (PARs) and the number of attributable cases for seven carcinogenic infections and their 20 associated cancers. A systematic literature search was performed for each infection to obtain data on infection prevalence in the population and the relative risk or odds ratio associated with the cancer it causes. When mechanistic evidence suggested that detection of a given infection within cancer tissue was sufficient to attribute the cancer to the infection, prevalence among cancer cases was used to approximate the PAR. Data from 61 studies formed the basis of our analyses. The estimated number of infection-attributable cancer cases for 2015 was: 3828 for human papillomavirus (HPV), 2052 for Helicobacter pylori, 578 for Epstein-Barr virus, 509 for hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV), 100 for human herpesvirus type 8, and 30 cases for human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1. These seven infections were responsible for 3.7% of cancers diagnosed among Canadian adults in 2015; 3.5% among men and 4.0% among women. The infections with the highest number of attributable cases are largely preventable or treatable through vaccination (HBV and HPV), antibiotic therapy (H. pylori), or a combination of interventions (HCV), thereby representing an important target for reducing the infection-caused cancer burden among Canadians.","

","PRIMARY SUBACUTE EPIPHYSEAL OSTEOMYELITIS CAUSED BY MYCOBACTERIUM SPECIES IN YOUNG CHILDREN: A MODERN DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH. Primary epiphyseal subacute osteomyelitis (PESAO) caused by Mycobacterium species in young children is poorly recognized. We aimed to define the spectrum of this uncommon condition and to propose a novel diagnostic approach. We performed a systematic review of the literature on the PubMed website by selecting all reports of isolated infantile PESAO caused by Mycobacterium species since 1975. We identified 350 citations, of which 174 were assessed for eligibility based on title and abstract. The full text of 81 eligible citations was screened, and relevant data of 15 children under 4Â years of age with mycobacterial PESAO were extracted. These data were pooled with those from our Institution. Data from 16 children were reviewed. The median age was 16âÂ±â7Â months and the male:female ratio 1.7.

It causes stress and requires the victim's adaptive capacity, which can cause psychological and biological changes. Hormone cortisol levels have been used as stress biomarker in several studies. This paper aims to perform a systematic literature review of publications on cortisol and violence involving teenagers from 2000 to 2013. Descriptors ""cortisol"", ""violence"" and ""adolescent"" were used in both English and Portuguese in this review, which included bibliographic databases PubMed/Medline, Lilacs, BVS and SciELO. Twelve papers were analyzed. Most studies involve participants from the United States, of both genders and without a control group. Different types of violence are studied, especially family violence, victimization or testimony. All studies used saliva to measure cortisol and no standard methodology was used for the analysis. Most studies (83.3%) found a statistically significant association between cortisol levels and exposure to violence. Results regarding gender, type of violence, socioeconomic status or cortisol analysis methods are not yet uniform.","

Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death in Western society, where about 20% of cases are triggered by a carotid stenosis or occlusion, which occurs more frequently in men than in women. The stroke-protective effect of carotid endarterectomy is greater in men. Men have lower peri-procedural stroke and death rates. Particularly men with carotid stenosis and a life expectancy of at least 5 years benefit from surgical treatment. Also, the recurrence rate of ipsilateral stroke 5 years after initial surgery is lower in men than in women. It is not yet fully clarified whether there are significant gender differences regarding the outcome after endovascular versus surgical treatment. Gender differences in the outcome of carotid artery repair may be caused by biological, anatomical (smaller vessel diameter in women) or hormonal differences as well as a protracted development of atherosclerotic changes in women and different plaque morphology. Moreover, women are on average older at the time of surgery and their surgical treatment is often delayed. To reduce the risk of stroke and to improve treatment outcome especially for women, further research on gender differences and their causes is mandatory and promising.","

Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale form dormant liver hypnozoites that can reactivate weeks to months following initial infection. Malaria recurrences caused by relapses are an important cause of morbidity and source of transmission. To estimate the proportions of P. vivax malaria recurrences caused by relapses in different geographical locations, we systematically reviewed clinical efficacy studies of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria, in which patients were randomized to treatment with or without radical cure primaquine regimens and were followed up for 1 year. The minimum proportion of recurrences caused by relapses was estimated for each study site by assuming primaquine prevented all relapses and did not augment blood-stage efficacy. Of the 261 studies identified, six were eligible enrolling 4,092 patients from 14 treatment arm comparisons across seven countries. Of the 2,735 patients treated with primaquine, 24.3% received low dose (2.5 to < 5.0 mg/kg total) and 75.7% received high-dose primaquine (â¥ 5.0 mg/kg total). The overall pooled incidence rate ratio of P. vivax relapses for patients treated with primaquine versus no primaquine was 0.15 (95% CI: 0.10-0.21; I 2 = 83.3%), equating to a minimum of 79% of recurrences attributable to relapse. Country-specific incidence rate ratios ranged from 0.05 (95% CI: 0.01-0.34; one estimate) in Pakistan to 0.34 in Nepal (95% CI: 0.12-0.83; one estimate) and Afghanistan (95% CI: 0.22-0.51; three estimates). Relapses account for a very high proportion of recurrent infections following schizontocidal treatment of acute P. vivax malaria across diverse geographic locations.

Based on class IV studies, there is insufficient evidence to determine if exposure to toxins encountered during the Persian Gulf war caused GWS (level U). A major limitation of the literature regarding the GWS is the reliance on self-reporting to measure exposure to putative causal toxins. Although objective measures of toxin exposure in GWV generally is unavailable, modeling techniques to estimate exposure levels to low-level nerve agents and smoke from oil well fires have been developed. It would be useful to determine if exposure levels determined by these techniques are associated with GWS. The lack of a clear case definition GWS also hampers research. Some go even further, claiming that the absence of such a definition renders the condition illegitimate. Although an objective marker to GWS would be useful for studies, the absence of such a marker does not make the syndrome any less legitimate. in essence, GWS merely is a convenient descriptive term that describes a phenomenon: GWV reporting suffering from medically unexplained health-related symptoms. In this sense, it shares much with the other medically unexplained syndromes encountered in practice. The real debate surrounding medically unexplained conditions is not whether or not they exist, but defining their cause. In this regard, investigators fall into two camps. One camp insists that the conditions are caused by a yet-to-be-discovered medical problem, rejecting out of hand the possibility of a psychologic origin. The other camp insists the conditions are fundamentally psychogenic rejecting the possibility of an undiscovered medical condition. The evidence shows, however, that the conditions exists, the suffering is real, and the causes are unknown.","

Prescribing errors are common, they result in adverse events and harm to patients and it is unclear how best to prevent them because recommendations are more often based on surmized rather than empirically collected data. The aim of this systematic review was to identify all informative published evidence concerning the causes of and factors associated with prescribing errors in specialist and non-specialist hospitals, collate it, analyse it qualitatively and synthesize conclusions from it. Seven electronic databases were searched for articles published between 1985-July 2008. The reference lists of all informative studies were searched for additional citations. To be included, a study had to be of handwritten prescriptions for adult or child inpatients that reported empirically collected data on the causes of or factors associated with errors. Publications in languages other than English and studies that evaluated errors for only one disease, one route of administration or one type of prescribing error were excluded. Seventeen papers reporting 16 studies, selected from 1268 papers identified by the search, were included in the review. Studies from the US and the UK in university-affiliated hospitals predominated (10/16 [62%]). The definition of a prescribing error varied widely and the included studies were highly heterogeneous. Causes were grouped according to Reason's model of accident causation into active failures, error-provoking conditions and latent conditions. The active failure most frequently cited was a mistake due to inadequate knowledge of the drug or the patient. Skills-based slips and memory lapses were also common. Where error-provoking conditions were reported, there was at least one per error. These included lack of training or experience, fatigue, stress, high workload for the prescriber and inadequate communication between healthcare professionals. Latent conditions included reluctance to question senior colleagues and inadequate provision of training. Prescribing errors are often multifactorial, with several active failures and error-provoking conditions often acting together to cause them. In the face of such complexity, solutions addressing a single cause, such as lack of knowledge, are likely to have only limited benefit. Further rigorous study, seeking potential ways of reducing error, needs to be conducted. Multifactorial interventions across many parts of the system are likely to be required.","

","DRIVING SIMULATORS IN THE CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF FITNESS TO DRIVE IN SLEEPY INDIVIDUALS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. Road traffic injuries are projected to be the leading cause of death for those aged between 15 and 29 years by the year 2030, and sleepiness is estimated to be the underlying cause in up to 15-20% of all motor vehicle accidents. Sleepiness at the wheel is most often caused by socially induced sleep deprivation or poor sleep hygiene in otherwise healthy individuals, medical disorders, or the intake of drugs. Validated methods for objectifying sleepiness are urgently sought, particularly in the context of driving. Based on the assumption that the identification and treatment of sleepiness, and its causes, may prevent motor vehicle accidents, driving simulators are a seemingly promising diagnostic tool. Despite the rising use of these in research, the reliability of their conclusions in healthy sleepy individuals and patients is still unclear. This systematic review aims to evaluate the practical value of driving simulators in a clinical environment when judging fitness to drive in sleepy individuals. From the 1674 records screened, 12 studies in sleepy individuals containing both simulated and real driving data were included. In general, simulated driving did not reliably predict real-life motor vehicle accidents, and especially not on an individual level, despite the moderate relationship between simulated and real-road test driving performance. The severity of sleepiness is most likely not the critical factor leading to motor vehicle accidents, but rather the perception of sleepiness. The self-perception of sleepiness related impairment, and risky behaviour while at the wheel should also be considered as key influencing factors.","

Road traffic injuries are projected to be the leading cause of death for those aged between 15 and 29 years by the year 2030, and sleepiness is estimated to be the underlying cause in up to 15-20% of all motor vehicle accidents. Sleepiness at the wheel is most often caused by socially induced sleep deprivation or poor sleep hygiene in otherwise healthy individuals, medical disorders, or the intake of drugs. Validated methods for objectifying sleepiness are urgently sought, particularly in the context of driving. Based on the assumption that the identification and treatment of sleepiness, and its causes, may prevent motor vehicle accidents, driving simulators are a seemingly promising diagnostic tool. Despite the rising use of these in research, the reliability of their conclusions in healthy sleepy individuals and patients is still unclear. This systematic review aims to evaluate the practical value of driving simulators in a clinical environment when judging fitness to drive in sleepy individuals. From the 1674 records screened, 12 studies in sleepy individuals containing both simulated and real driving data were included. In general, simulated driving did not reliably predict real-life motor vehicle accidents, and especially not on an individual level, despite the moderate relationship between simulated and real-road test driving performance. The severity of sleepiness is most likely not the critical factor leading to motor vehicle accidents, but rather the perception of sleepiness. The self-perception of sleepiness related impairment, and risky behaviour while at the wheel should also be considered as key influencing factors.","

","TARGETING INFECTIOUS AGENTS AS A THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent dementia in the world. Its cause(s) are presently largely unknown. The most common explanation for AD, now, is the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which states that the cause of AD is senile plaque formation by the amyloid Î² peptide, and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles by hyperphosphorylated tau. A second, burgeoning theory by which to explain AD is based on the infection hypothesis. Much experimental and epidemiological data support the involvement of infections in the development of dementia. According to this mechanism, the infection either directly or via microbial virulence factors precedes the formation of amyloid Î² plaques. The amyloid Î² peptide, possessing antimicrobial properties, may be beneficial at an early stage of AD, but becomes detrimental with the progression of the disease, concomitantly with alterations to the innate immune system at both the peripheral and central levels. Infection results in neuroinflammation, leading to, and sustained by, systemic inflammation, causing eventual neurodegeneration, and the senescence of the immune cells. The sources of AD-involved microbes are various body microbiome communities from the gut, mouth, nose, and skin. The infection hypothesis of AD opens a vista to new therapeutic approaches, either by treating the infection itself or modulating the immune system, its senescence, or the body's metabolism, either separately, in parallel, or in a multi-step way.",,"

Twenty-seven articles were selected, 74.4% of which were published in public health journals, with 66.7% having an ecological study design. Nearly all articles addressed cause groups and their components (66.7%), followed by the remaining third, which addressed the identification of the determinant factors of the deaths. The Southeast region produced over 37% of the studies. In most Brazilians cities and states, there was a reduction of deaths by more than 50% by the end of the 1900s. Among the cause of death groups, the diarrhea-pneumonia group was predominant, followed by congenital abnormalities. The basic life conditions according to socioeconomic indicators - housing, basic sanitation, education, and accessibility to health - were determinants for the highest postnatal death rates due to reducible causes.","

","SOLVENTS AND PARKINSON DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF TOXICOLOGICAL AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE. Parkinson disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative motor disorder, with its motor symptoms largely attributable to loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The causes of PD remain poorly understood, although environmental toxicants may play etiologic roles. Solvents are widespread neurotoxicants present in the workplace and ambient environment. Case reports of parkinsonism, including PD, have been associated with exposures to various solvents, most notably trichloroethylene (TCE). Animal toxicology studies have been conducted on various organic solvents, with some, including TCE, demonstrating potential for inducing nigral system damage. However, a confirmed animal model of solvent-induced PD has not been developed. Numerous epidemiologic studies have investigated potential links between solvents and PD, yielding mostly null or weak associations. An exception is a recent study of twins indicating possible etiologic relations with TCE and other chlorinated solvents, although findings were based on small numbers, and dose-response gradients were not observed. At present, there is no consistent evidence from either the toxicological or epidemiologic perspective that any specific solvent or class of solvents is a cause of PD. Future toxicological research that addresses mechanisms of nigral damage from TCE and its metabolites, with exposure routes and doses relevant to human exposures, is recommended. Improvements in epidemiologic research, especially with regard to quantitative characterization of long-term exposures to specific solvents, are needed to advance scientific knowledge on this topic.",,"

Although many of these studies will illustrate the ""healthy worker effect"" with deficits in mortality, particularly from cardiovascular causes, a thorough review should indicate certain exposures needing further research. A recently published study of heart disease mortality in the rubber industry illustrates the potential use of such a literature review with subsequent follow up. Production workers in the rubber industry have shown small excesses in CAHD mortality. A follow-up study at one plant confirmed the known association between carbon disulfide and atherosclerosis, as well as suggested two new causal associations between CAHD and the use of phenol and ethanol as solvents. What additional techniques can be used to generate hypotheses on heart disease and occupation? Some possibilities include: A recent article describes the use of the results of occupational disease surveillance systems for occupational cancer research. A review of such systems for heart disease would be equally useful. It would be useful to review the quality and quantity of occupational data that has been collected in prospective cohort studies, such as those in Framingham and Evans County.

","REPAIRING THE HEART: STATE-OF THE ART DELIVERY STRATEGIES FOR BIOLOGICAL THERAPEUTICS. Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. It is caused by an acute imbalance between oxygen supply and demand in the myocardium, usually caused by an obstruction in the coronary arteries. The conventional therapy is based on the application of (a combination of) anti-thrombotics, reperfusion strategies to open the occluded artery, stents and bypass surgery. However, numerous patients cannot fully recover after these interventions. In this context, new therapeutic methods are explored. Three decades ago, the first biologicals were tested to improve cardiac regeneration. Angiogenic proteins gained popularity as potential therapeutics. This is not straightforward as proteins are delicate molecules that in order to have a reasonably long time of activity need to be stabilized and released in a controlled fashion requiring advanced delivery systems. To ensure long-term expression, DNA vectors-encoding for therapeutic proteins have been developed. Here, the nuclear membrane proved to be a formidable barrier for efficient expression. Moreover, the development of delivery systems that can ensure entry in the target cell, and also correct intracellular trafficking towards the nucleus are essential. The recent introduction of mRNA as a therapeutic entity has provided an attractive intermediate: prolonged but transient expression from a cytoplasmic site of action. However, protection of the sensitive mRNA and correct delivery within the cell remains a challenge. This review focuses on the application of synthetic delivery systems that target the myocardium to stimulate cardiac repair using proteins, DNA or RNA.","

Given the limitations of vaccines and antiviral drugs, novel therapeutics to modulate host responses and improve outcomes in severe influenza are needed. One strategy is to learn from the direct comparison of high-survivor versus high-mortality animal models. This review surveys the results of lung transcriptome profiling studies in murine models that directly compare susceptible versus resistant hosts challenged with identical influenza infections. The potential contributions and limitations of these studies are discussed. To amplify their power, the studies are subjected to a meta-analysis, which helps identify frequently dysregulated pathways and potentially novel areas for investigation. Using connectivity map-based tools (LINCS), transcriptome signatures linked to susceptibility can identify candidate drugs that merit testing for in vivo efficacy.","

","CAUSAL FACTORS OF CORRUPTION IN CONSTRUCTION PROJECT MANAGEMENT: AN OVERVIEW. The development of efficient and strategic anti-corruption measures can be better achieved if a deeper understanding and identification of the causes of corruption are established. Over the past years, many studies have been devoted to the research of corruption in construction management (CM). This has resulted in a significant increase in the body of knowledge on the subject matter, including the causative factors triggering these corrupt practices. However, an apropos systematic assessment of both past and current studies on the subject matter which is needful for the future endeavor is lacking. Moreover, there is an absence of unified view of the causative factors of corruption identified in construction project management (CPM). This paper, therefore, presents a comprehensive review of the causes of corruption from selected articles in recognized construction management journals to address the mentioned gaps. A total number of 44 causes of corruption were identified from 37 publications and analyzed in terms of existing causal factors of corruption, annual trend of publications and the thematic categorization of the identified variables. The most identifiable causes were over close relationships, poor professional ethical standards, negative industrial and working conditions, negative role models and inadequate sanctions. A conceptual framework of causes of corruption was established, after categorizing the 44 variables into five unique categories. In descending order, the five constructs are Psychosocial-Specific Causes, Organizational-Specific Causes, Regulatory-Specific Causes, Project-Specific Causes and Statutory-Specific Causes. This study extends the current literature of corruption research in construction management and contributes to a deepened understanding of the causal instigators of corruption identified in CPM. The findings from this study provide valuable information and extended knowledge to industry practitioners and policymakers as well as anti-corruption agencies in the formulation and direction of anti-corruption measures.
